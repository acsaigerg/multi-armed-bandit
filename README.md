# Multi Armed Bandit RL environment

This is a simple implementation of a multi-armed (k-armed) bandit environment for reinforcement learning.

## Action space
The action space is discrete and consists of k actions. Each action is associated with a reward, which is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
